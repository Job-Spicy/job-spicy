# Agile Methodology Reflection

## Prompt 
As a group, answer the questions below. For each of these questions, consider specific examples to support your narrative.

1. Reflect on your team's communication processes. How did Agile practices, such as **daily stand-up** meetings, facilitate communication and collaboration among team members?
2. How did maintaining a **scrum board** play a role in the organization and delegation of tasks in your project?
3. Reflect on your team's prioritization of tasks. How did your team create a **timeline for reaching MVP** and how did this prioritization assist in accomplishing your goals?
4. What would you have done differently as a group to improve your communication, prioritization, or delegation of tasks?

**Write your reflection using markdown**.

## Reflection Response

1. Daily stand-ups helped provide clear objectives for each day to ensure that the pace of the project matched the timeline and that each team member knew what they and the other person were capable of. On days where I was the only person on campus, I would send a mid-day update around lunch and an end of the day update with what I accomplished and what I was hoping the other person would accomplish. It was always very clear to understand the progress of the project, and it was very easy to break down tasks because there was a clear structure.

2. The scrum board was crucial to understand what tasks needed to be done that day and to measure progress throughout the week. The scrum board also provided a way to view requirements from the project checklists and our own tickets at the same time. The assignee feature made it easy to delegate tasks and remember responsibilities. The scrum board was also helpful in breaking tasks down into smaller sub-tasks. It was a good way to see how all the tasks in the project relate to its features.

3. A timeline was created based on taking the expectations for MVP and breaking it down into subtasks. The subtasks were put in an order so that each one builds off the last one. For example, you need a Vite project and a wireframe to be able to build out and render components in the future. The timeline was also mapped out based on strengths and weaknesses. Tasks that felt very easy to me would take up a smaller part of the timeline than tasks that I wasn’t so confident in completing, so that I could proactively allocate more time for errors and solidifying my understanding.

4. What I would have done differently was be more firm on the distribution of work. I felt very lenient because the situation was out of my partner’s control, but I needed to accept that I was too far in the project to be able to say that it was a group effort. I’m good at noticing this when another team member is deliberately not contributing, but it was more difficult to draw the line when a team member is trying their best but still isn’t pulling their weight.
